				We’re here to take your headaches away when it comes to getting healthy and keeping fit. Our teams of experts are here to create a tailored diet and workout solution for you, incorporating your health and fitness desires into our ‘Simple Plan’. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a member of the Simple Plan, you will not only have a personal trainer, but also a dietitian assigned to you. Their job is to work together to help you achieve your health and fitness desires, whether you’re looking to build your physical strength, work on your aesthetic tone, or increase your stamina and energy levels.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our personal trainers are highly experienced experts when it comes to exercise prescription and instruction. That means they’re not just going to tell you what to do, but they’ll show you how and monitor your ability, giving you the peace of mind of knowing you’re getting the maximum effect from the time you put in to working out.
			</p>
			<p>

			<p>
				“Health is wealth” is what we truly believe here at Simple Gym. We get satisfaction from knowing that we’ve made a positive difference to your lives, through our expertise and your hard work. Unfortunately, what we’ve noticed is that our competitors are often more interested in selling the product with the highest paying commissions rather than giving you well grounded unbiased advice.
			</p>
			<p>
			How many times have you been promised that if you purchase a particular diet, or attend a particular fitness class you’ll gain everything from amazing strength and stamina to a toned body? Isn’t it suspicious that they seem to think the same solution will work for everyone?	
			</p>
			<p>
			Frustrated by the constant misinformation that gets thrown around today by false advertisers we decided to set up a place were people who understand that there is no magic solution could get real, personal advice as well as the facilities to work out. We know that getting and staying healthy takes real knowledge and hard work. We’re here to provide the knowledge, and the means, but you have to put in the hard work!

			Here at Simple Gym we know too well that we’re not all built the same. We wanted to create an environment that lets people of all abilities work together but also gives you a helping hand in decided what’s best for you. We hope that with this, you’ll be able to make the most of the time you spend in the gym, and not have to worry about the endless conflicting information from diet regime and fitness class vendors out there	
			</p>
			<p>
				This isn’t a magic formula, it just good old-fashioned hard work, combined with a personal diet plan, based on your current condition and your goals.
